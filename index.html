        <p>The kinds of games I enjoy the most tend to be turn-based JRPG games or more slow paced
            kinds, things like strategy/tactical/Dungeon Crawlers and more as long as they have some
            form of RPG elements in them. My favourite games mostly come from Atlus with their games such
            as Etrian Odyssey and Shin Megami Tensei as well as their spin-offs such as Devil Survivor
            and Etrian Mystery Dungeon.

            <h1>Games I have Made</h1>
            <p>There are 2 games I'm moderately proud of, one is a short turn-based dungeon crawler,
                the other one is a escape game.
            </p>

            <h2>The Great Escape</h2>
            <p>It is a simple dungeon crawler where your main goal is to get to the end goal
                which is a big doorway. On the way to getting to the goal, the player will be
                attacked through random encounters where they have to fight to continue, if they
                run out of hp, they will lose the game but if they win then they will earn experience
                points. If they earn enough experience points then they will lvl up which will restore
                their HP and MP to continue fighting.

                <br>
                <br>
                
                The camera controls I have taken from how older dungeon crawlers like smt on NES
                or etrian odyssey on the DS did it, a fixed 90 degree turn in either left or right
                direction.

              <h2>The Unknown Tower</h2>
              <p>
                For this game, I decided with making a lava room that rises every few seconds while the
                player tries to run away to unlock the door before escaping through it, should they not do
                it fast enough, then they will die and restart the level.

                <br><br>

                For the other levels it's more simple like the first level, it's 2 levels in one and jumping
                through a certain block will swap between level 1 and level 2. 
                
                <br><br>

                last 2 levels are more to showcase the slimes, it has basic ai from patroling, to chasing player,
                dying, then heading back to it's spawn point should it die before respawning itself again.
                
                <br><br>

                Last stage is a race against a slime, if the slime gets to the end first, then the player
                will die and have to restart.

                <br><br>

                For the main menu, I added a music library that lets you play any of the 3 songs in the game,
                 if the song is already playing then it won't change, otherwise it will lower the music players
                 volume until it hits 0, then changes the music before bringing it back up so that it doesn't
                 feels so abrupt when the music changes.

            <h1>Studio Projects</h1>
            <p>There are 2 studio projects that I feel I have done enough of to mention. 1 is a 
                parody of squid game, the other a rogue like shooter game.
            </p>

            <br>

            <h2>Super Pain</h2>
            <p>The first project is the game Super Pain, in this project I have made the entire
                shop system, helped out with the weapon selection (Mainly transition screen to
                main game as well as a border to highlight the weapons when the player hovers
                over them), and lastly, I did the map generation so that the rocks and trees are
                spawned randomly every time to block the players as well as a "Super Pain" power
                that has a low chance of spawning that will shake the screen and kill every enemy
                within a certain distance from the player.

                <br>
                <br>
                To minimize lag and slowdowns I've done distance rendering where if enemies and objects
                are far enough away from the player, they will not be rendered until they get close enough
                to the player again.

                <br>
                <br>

                One extra thing i've added is a way to save the players upgrades they bought from the store,
                that way they do not have to waste time getting gold again to upgrade from scratch.
            </p>

            <h2>Scam Game</h2>
            <p>
                I was unable to get the project again for it, but I do remember what I did on it.
                It's nothing much other than collision detection, the lobby scene where it renders
                beds but renders lesser beds as the player goes through the different sections of the game.
                Lastly, I did the "Simon says" where the player will have to stand on the same color as displayed
                on the screen otherwise they die.
